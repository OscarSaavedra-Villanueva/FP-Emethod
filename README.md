Fingerprint-enhanced method to segment and analyze collagen-fibers

The fingerprint-enhanced method is a MATLAB (The MathWorks Inc.) tool for automatically extracting the fibrillar collagen network, and analyzing them, from a stack of second harmonic generation (SHG) microscope images. 
It also works when the collagen fibers are fluorescently labeled. The method has been discussed in detail in our published work which you can find at https://doi.org/10.1111/boc.70001

The software execution requires MATLAB and MATLAB image processing toolbox and was extensively tested in MATLAB 2022b. 
However, it should run on older MATLAB versions.

The library contains third-party dependencies which are the following:
